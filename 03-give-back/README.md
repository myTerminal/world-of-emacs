## Give Back

Once you are comfortable enough in the World of Emacs, you should consider giving back to the community that helped you get started and get things done in a much more fun way than you used to do, for free.

1. [Write your own extensions](01-write-your-own-extensions.md)
   Emacs has a package to do almost everything you can imagine. Just in case you find something that is not there already, you can create one yourself and share it with the loving Emacs community.
2. [Help others learn](02-help-others-learn.md)
   May be when you think you have learnt enough, it is your turn to pass on the knowledge to others who are at the point at start where you used to be.
