# More than just basics

Once you start getting comfortable with Emacs, you do not need to go through the basics anymore. The key-bindings that used to be so difficult, now start becoming muscle memory to the fingers.

None of us would be able to learn Emacs entirely. We start with learning only as much as we need and then we keep going back to a few guides to learn more as we go. Fortunately, our fellow-creatures have already created a lot of such reference material for us that we can refer.

## The ergoemacs website

The [ergoemacs website](http://ergoemacs.org), although it looks dated (as mentioned earlier), can form a good reference material to learn more of Emacs.

There they also have training material for [Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp), which is a dilect of the beautiful language of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)). Knowing at least a bit of Emacs Lisp (or Elisp) helps customize Emacs better. Who knows, you would end up creating your own Emacs extensions with Elisp!

## The Emacs mini manual and more by tuhdo

This [website](http://tuhdo.github.io) has lot of information about Emacs starting from the 'Why' and 'How' that we covered earlier to advanced topics like programming language specific setups and much more.

## The GNU Emacs Manual

If you like reading detailed, lengthy manuals, you can also go through the [GNU Emacs Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html) provided by GNU itself.

## Emacs.sexy

This one is [a noteworthy website](http://emacs.sexy) that has quite a lot of references to places where you can find information about Emacs.
