# Share your Emacs

A few weeks into using Emacs, you realize that you have created an Emacs of your own. Well actually, you do not create an Emacs of your own, but you manage to put together some configuration that works really well with your workflow, and that configuration makes 'your' Emacs different than the stock Emacs and that from the others.

A very common trend is to create a project on GitHub and share your dotfiles (a collection of configuration of files on your computer, not just Emacs configuration) with the rest of the world. This practice makes available so many dotfiles for us to have a look and adopt small parts of in our own dotfiles.

Apart from helping others, this can also help you share the same configuration across multiple computers running different operating systems. I have personally been using the same configuration across all my three computers running Mac OS, Fedora Linux and Windows.

You can find a small list of a few noteworthy Emacs configurations [https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#noteworthy-configurations](https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#noteworthy-configurations).

Apart from Emacs, you can also find other dotfiles at [https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles) and [https://dotfiles.github.io](https://dotfiles.github.io).

Lastly, you can also have a look at [my dotfiles](https://github.com/myTerminal/dotfiles), self-promotion you know!
