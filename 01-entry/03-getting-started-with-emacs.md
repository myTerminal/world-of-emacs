# Getting Started with Emacs

Learning Emacs can be overwhelming, especially at the start. Afterall, it is not just a text-editor to edit files!

Emacs needs some patience and dedication at the start but when things start to sink in, one would soon realize that the initial time spent was well worth it.

Remember: The start will be slow and within a couple of days, you could be fairly comfortable.

Below are a set of steps that I recommend to go through to get started in a systematic manner:

## The inbuilt Emacs Tutorial

Go through the entire Emacs tutorial that is a part of Emacs itself. To start the tutorial, launch Emacs and from the welcome screen, select the option that says 'Emacs Tutorial'.

You will be presented with a long-running screen full of text with 'learn-as-you-do' instructions to help you get acquainted with the basic key-bindings to get though your initial days within Emacs. Proceed through the tutorial slowly, do not rush. You may want to do it more than once to make sure you are comfortable.

## Emacs Guided Tour

You can view the Emacs Guided Tour from the same screen where you started the previous tutorial. An option is located on the next line.

This one opens up a web page in your web-browser. You can also visit it here: [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour).

You'll be happy to see some colorful pictures after going through screens full of plain text.

## Alternate 'Practical' Tutorial

[ergoemacs.org](http://ergoemacs.org) is a not-so-pretty website that has a lot of useful information on Emacs.

You can also visit [http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs.html](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs.html) for a 'practical' tutorial.

## Yet Another Emacs Tutorial

[David Rothlisberger](http://david.rothlis.net) has created a good website as a detailed [tutorial for Emacs](http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/tutorial.html) where he talks about everything from installation to using it. Besides, the website is neat!

## A Reference card

Refer this [reference card](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf) along the way. Do not worry about learning every single shortcut right away.

I like to print it and pin it at my desk at office.

Also, consider using this cheatsheet. It's a good one with minimal basics.
