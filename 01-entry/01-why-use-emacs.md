# Why Use Emacs?

After a file-browser, a text-editor is the most used software on a computer and as a software developer, I consider myself eligible to state that developers spend most of their time on a computer within a text-editor, except for the time we spend with command-line windows.
There is a massive variety of text-editors for one to use and many people do not care much for which one they use, especially when they can get their most common day-to-day tasks done without learning anything specific to use it.

Emacs is not just a text-editor. Some even call it an operating system, which comes from the fact that one can possibly do everything that they do on their computer from within an Emacs window.

So why should one use Emacs? There could be way too many reasons. You can read some of them in one of my posts I wrote in 2015: [Still Editing Macros in 2015](http://ismail.teamfluxion.com/#!/diary/20150502/Still_Editing_Macros_in_2015).
