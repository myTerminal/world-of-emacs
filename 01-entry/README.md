## Entry

A typical entry to the World of Emacs follows a pattern where a non-user turns into a fan and unofficial promoter who alienates other bodies around by mentioning how they perform a specific task from within Emacs and make them leave the conversation at the least.

1. [Question: Why use Emacs?](01-why-use-emacs.md)
   Text-editors seemingly have limited purpose in an average individual's life. There are plenty of them around and some are more appealing than the others. This brings a question to mind: "Why use Emacs at the first place?".
2. [Question: How to get Emacs?](02-how-to-get-emacs.md)
   Emacs comes in different forms. Which one you need depends on (or dictates your) workflow. You need to find one for yourself and no matter which form you get and from where, it is always free.
3. [Getting Started with Emacs](03-getting-started-with-emacs.md)
   There is a huge crowd of selfless people waiting to get you in and there is a variety of tutorials available for you to go through. Emacs has one in itself.
