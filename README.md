A brief guide for getting into and through the World of Emacs

## Background

It is an established fact that Emacs is not just a text-editor that you get reminded of only when you need to edit a text file. Emacs is a multi-tool that one can use for everything they do on a computer.

I use the term **World of Emacs** as Emacs is surrounded by experiences of unusual kinds and depths that are not explannable to non-users (or disbelievers), creating a level of addiction that lures oneself more into it, replacing all other tools used for day-to-day workflow by alternatives from within Emacs and sometimes creating their own tools, thereby contributing to this free community that share onething in common: their love for Emacs.

## [Entry](01-entry)

A typical entry to the World of Emacs follows a pattern where a non-user turns into a fan and unofficial promoter who alienates other bodies around by mentioning how they perform a specific task from within Emacs and make them leave the conversation at the least.

1. [Question: Why use Emacs?](01-entry/01-why-use-emacs.md)
   Text-editors seemingly have limited purpose in an average individual's life. There are plenty of them around and some are more appealing than the others. This brings a question to mind: "Why use Emacs at the first place?".
2. [Question: How to get Emacs?](01-entry/02-how-to-get-emacs.md)
   Emacs comes in different forms. Which one you need depends on (or dictates your) workflow. You need to find one for yourself and no matter which form you get and from where, it is always free.
3. [Getting Started with Emacs](01-entry/03-getting-started-with-emacs.md)
   There is a huge crowd of selfless people waiting to get you in and there is a variety of tutorials available for you to go through. Emacs has one in itself.

## [Daily Life](02-daily-life)

A regular life in the World of Emacs is full of learning, excitement and pure satisfaction. One never learns enough Emacs ever due to its vast nature.

1. [More than just basics](02-daily-life/01-more-than-just-basics.md)
   After the point when you manage to convince yourself in using Emacs in your workflow and after getting a bit comfortable with it, there are cheatsheets, detailed references that you can keep coming back to everyday.
2. [Share your Emacs](02-daily-life/02-share-your-emacs.md)
   A stock Emacs transforms into *your Emacs* over a period of time due to its extensibility and customizable nature. One trend with Emacs users is to share your configurations with the community and it helps in unimaginable ways.

## [Give Back](03-give-back)

Once you are comfortable enough in the World of Emacs, you should giving back to the community that helped you get started and get things done in a much more fun way than you used to do, for free.

1. [Write your own extensions](03-give-back/01-write-your-own-extensions.md)
   Emacs has a package to do anything and everything. Just in case you find something that is not there already, you can create one yourself and share it with the loving Emacs community.
2. [Help others learn](03-give-back/02-help-others-learn.md)
   May be when you think you have learnt enough, it is your turn to pass on the knowledge to others who are at the point where you used to be.
